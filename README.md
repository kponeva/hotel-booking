# hotel-booking

> ## *Context*

Every year, more than 140 million bookings made on the internet and many hotel bookings made through top-visited travel websites like Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, etc. According to Google data, hotels are booked in advance of 12 weeks.

The original dataset contains 31 features about booking information such as Average Daily Rate, Arrival Time, Room Type, Special Request, etc. between 2015 and 2017 years.

In this kernel, I would like to show some booking information details with exploratory data analysis, some feature engineering, reviewing correlations between features, hyperparameter tuning and model performance. As a result of all these analyses, I aim to find best model to predict hotel booking cancellations with an algorithm that gives best performance. The goal of predictive analysis is to avoid overfitting and find the model that has the highest accuracy.

> ## *Business Problem*

**Problem**:  
How to predict the guests who are most likely to cancel and not cancel their reservation? Will this help to generate better forecasts and reduce business decision uncertainty?

**Data**:  
The dataset provides information to help us find evaluate feature importance i.e. which features are most important to predict hotel booking cancellations.

**ML Objective**:  
To build a model that could predict bookings with a high cancellation probability.

**Action**:  
Results allow hotel managers to accurately predict net demand and build better forecasts, improve cancellation policies, define better overbooking tactics and thus use more assertive pricing and inventory allocation strategies.

**Value**:
- To mitigate revenue loss derived from booking cancellations
- To mitigate the risks associated  with overbooking (reallocation costs, cash or service compensations, and particularly important today, social reputation costs)
